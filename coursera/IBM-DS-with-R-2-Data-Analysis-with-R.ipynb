You have just been hired by a US Weather forecast firm as a data scientist.\n","\n","The company is considering the weather condition to help predict the possibility of precipitations, which involves using various local climatological variables, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure. The data you will be handling was collected by a NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York.\n","\n","Your task is to provide a high level analysis of weather data in JFK Airport. Your stakeholders want to understand the current and historical record of precipitations based on different variables. For now they are mainly interested in a macro-view of JFK Airport Weather, and how it relates to the possibility to rain because it will affect flight delays and etc.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6673126d-bb28-4926-b92f-475e8605e3c9","metadata":{},"source":["# Introduction\n","\n","This project relates to the NOAA Weather Dataset - JFK Airport (New York).
