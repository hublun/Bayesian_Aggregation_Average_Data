You just need to use HTTP requests to call those weather APIs and get the weather data.\n","\n","You will be given instructions to set up a free OpenWeather API account with an API key for authentication. Then, you will be shown, with code examples, how to get the current weather for a given city. After you are familiar with OpenWeather API, you will be asked to get 5-day forecast data for a list of cities.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d12a7d4-b410-4c4b-81fe-89051d3318b2","metadata":{},"source":["## Setup OpenWeather API account\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"75c6e554-5109-4487-bdeb-e1a394f0af10","metadata":{},"source":["You can create an OpenWeather API account [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
